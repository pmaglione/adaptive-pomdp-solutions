KNOWN ISSUE
------------
Because of the way Amazon Mechanical Turk works, the following scenario will
cause AgentHunt to not terminate:
1) Worker Bob accepts an assignment
2) Worker Bob abandons the assignment he accepts (he does not complete it)
MTurk does not notify the requester of such scenarios and does not provide
an API that allows one to check for abandoned assignments, leading AgentHunt
to believe that once a task has been accepted, it will be completed. Thus,
it will continue to wait for Worker Bob to complete the assignment. An attempt
at a fix will lead to race conditions. 

Thus, we recommend that your workflow preview enables workers to make a 
good assessment of whether or not they wish to complete the task.
AgentHunt also logs all results from workers, so that if such a scenario occurs,
data is not lost.
Finally, AgentHunt is written so that you can use a "fake" mechanical turk.
The file MTurk/SimMT.py allows you to poll your own files for observations
instead of mechanical turk. To use this mechanism, change the following line
in main.py:
mt = RealMT(...
to
mt = SimMT(...
Obviously, you can rewrite SimMT to read files in whatever format you wish.
